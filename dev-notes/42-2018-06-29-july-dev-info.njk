  <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4">[42] July Development Details</h1>

  <p>[ 2018.06.29 ]</p>

  <p>Hello Ragnarok Zero users, this is the Ragnarok Zero team from RO1 Studio. Today we will let you know about the updates that will be made in July.</p>

  <h2>1. Change the environment when you're not able to battle</h2>

  <p>We have received inquiries in the customer center related to the summoning method of some of the bosses. People have said things like: "If a character is unable to combat for an extended period of time, they should be moved to town." or "If you are unable to fight, please make sure that the broadcast of the boss summoning system itself is invisible".</p>

  <p>Generally it seems like people are leaving "not-combatable" (i.e. dead) characters in the area where the boss appears, checking the summoning announcements and then hurrying to go after the boss once it's summoned.</p>

  <p>Summoning-related announcements work to inform users who enter the map for the first time what's happening there and visually informing them of changes in the map.</p>

  <p>Removing the announcments altogether would be inconvenient for those uesrs who first enter the map.</p>

  <p>So, we will make it so that non-combatable characters won't be able to see monsters nor announcements. They will still be able to see other peripheral characters and NPCs.</p>

  <h2>2. Play Dead change</h2>

  <p>Novices using Play Dead will still be able to see nearby monsters, but we will change how Play Dead works to the following:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6">
    <li>A duration of 30 seconds will be added. You can not undo Play Dead during those 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>A skill cooldown of 60 seconds will be added.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Changing how Memorial Dungeon Enchant Association enchants work</h2>

  <p>After the 2nd Job Essence Enchants were added with the 2nd job update, a request was received to add more that cater to a wider play style.</p>

  <p>As a result, a new set of 2nd Job Essence Enchants will be added, bringing the total to 64 types of enchants.</p>

  <p>Because of this, with the existing enchantment method, the probability of obtaining an essence enchant is very low.</p>

  <p>We have decided to modify how the Essence Enchant NPCs work to the following:</p>

  <h3>1st Job Essence Enchant NPC</h3>

  <p>Enchant NPC with a chance of granting 1st Job Essence Enchant (Lvl 1 - 2) for Memorial Dungeon armor that is +9 or higher. Each attempt costs 100,000 zeny. For Expedition armor, it enchants in the 4th slot. For Dispatching, 3rd slot. For Conquering, 2nd slot. This enchant method is the same as for the existing Enchant Association NPC.</p>

  <h3>2nd Job Essence Enchant NPC</h3>

  <p>Enchant NPC with a chance of granting 2nd Job Essence Enchant (Lvl 1 - 2) for Memorial Dungeon armor that is +9 or higher. Each attempt costs 100,000 zeny. For Expedition armor, it enchants in the 4th slot. For Dispatching, 3rd slot. For Conquering, 2nd slot. This enchant method is the same as for the existing Enchant Association NPC.</p>

  <h3>Ninja Essence Enchant NPC</h3>

  <p>Enchant NPC with a chance of granting a Ninja Essence Enchant (Lvl 1 - 2) for Memorial Dungeon armor that is +9 or higher. Each attempt costs 100,000 zeny. For Expedition armor, it enchants in the 4th slot. For Dispatching, 3rd slot. For Conquering, 2nd slot. This enchant method is the same as for the existing Enchant Association NPC.</p>

  <p>In addition, because there is a difference in the number of job essence enchants possible per NPC, the NPCs with more job essence enchants have a higher probability of granting one vs the NPCs that have a smaller list of possible job essence enchants to give.</p>

  <p>At the same time as the above changes are made, the services of the "Intermediate Merchant Association Staff" will be terminated.</p>
