  <h2>Steal skill improvement</h2>

  <p>There are no random options for equipment currently stolen by Thieves using Steal. In the future, this will be corrected.</p>

  <h2>New areas</h2>

  <p>At the same time as the second job class update, three new dungeons will be opened, and some of the dungeons are made up of the "Fever" area.</p>

  <h3>Turtle Island Dungeon</h3>

  <p>Turtle Island Dungeon, consisting of one field and three dungeon levels (a total of four maps), is a dungeon specializing in insect and animal monsters. You can take a boat from Alberta.</p>

  <h3>Clock Tower Dungeon</h3>

  <p>The Clock Tower in the center of Aldebaran, which is composed of various levels, is a dungeon specaliazing in formless monsters.</p>

  <h3>Glast Heim Dungeon</h3>

  <p>The Glast Heim Dungeon, located to the west of Geffen, is a complex dungeon consisting of various dungeons. There are various kinds of monsters such as demon, undead, and insect types.</p>

  <h2>Direction of New Fever Areas</h2>

  <p>In the old Fever areas, there were two benefits: acquiring equipment and acquiring experience. The experience points were there to help level up to second job. For the newly added Fever areas after the second job update, the focus will be on equipment acquisition rather than experience.</p>

  <h2>New Memorial Dungeons & Memorial Dungeon Equipment Update</h2>

  <p>3 new memorial dungeons will be added. These new memorial dungeons will have min-level requirements of 70, 80 and 99. New equipment will be added with new dungeons and the equipment will be upgradable with previous equipments + jello stones and other materials.</p>

  <h2>Party item distribution change</h2>

  <p>Normally when the item is looted, the person who picks up the item was shared within 11x11 cells of the looter. The new sharing mechanism will be 31x31 around the party leader will be shared, but those who are looting outside of 31x31 cell will individually loot and not be shared.</p>

  <h2>Change the weight limit value of some manufacturing skills</h2>

  <p>Arrow Creation and Stone Picking skills will be usable up to 70% overweight instead of 50% overweight.</p>
